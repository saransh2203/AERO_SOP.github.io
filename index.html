			<h4 style = "color:white; font-size:17px;">I feel that I am a highly motivated person when it comes to showcasing my creative traits <br> and this POR is an amazing opportunity to not only showcase my skills but also help <br> the club grow in the best possible way I can. Leading a team is a great experience and <br> exposure as well. I would love to lead the media team of the Aerodynamics club as I feel <br> I have the skills needed and I believe that I can be a good leader.</h4>

            <h4 class = "video" style= "font-size:17px;">As the name suggests, Design and Content Head, I can say that I have a good amount<br> of experience in the field of designing and content writing through different clubs<br>and departements.
                I have created various posts/posters/videos for many of our college <br>related events, a few of them including the trailer of Spree Glow Party held in March when <br>I was a crew member , Spree Sports Wrap for the official page of BITS Spree, <br>etc. I am well versed in designing softwares  such as DaVinci Resolve for video <br>editing and Canva for photo editing.

			<h4 style = "color:white; font-size:17px;">I have a good amount of experience in video editing through DaVinci Resolve <br>and have been doing it for more than a year now.
                Few of my experiences outside <br>the club related to designing have been making the following: <br><br>
                <div class = "lists">
                    Prom Night Video<br>
                    NaReal Awards<br>
                    Glow Party<br>
                    Spree September Wrap<br>
                    SAE Video for PitchTech during Convocation<br>
                    Ganesh Chaturthi Posters<br><br>

                Other than content creation, a Design and Content head is also responsible for publicity<br> through social media. I have worked with DePP extensively refining this skill and bringing<br> good publicity to the Department and the events as well.

                I haven’t had any chance to present <br>my creative side in the Aerodynamics Club and this is what I am looking to change through<br> this POR. This is the perfect opportunity for me to help my club in the best way possible.
</h4>
            <div class= "visions">
                <h4 style = "color:white; font-size:17px;">As a design and content head, my first vision for this club would be to increase its outreach<br> which would definitely be done through social media. This Waves is a great opportunity<br> for us to showcase something from the Aero club even though it's a cultural fest. Inductions is <br>another thing I am looking forward to. To nurture an ambience of learning amongst the new<br> inductees would be one of the things I hope I could do well. Promoting the activities and events of<br> the club is a very important part of my agenda. We have had many guest lectures and events and <br>had decent turnout from the students but I feel that can further be improved by a huge<br> margin and this is something I would like to work upon as I love challenges.
                Ultimately I would<br> also want the Aero club to represent BITS Pilani, Goa campus at a national and international level <br>by not only participating in competitions but also bringing in good results.
                </h4>

                <h4 class="exp" style = "color:white; font-size:17px;">
                    My experience in the Aerodynamics Club has been amazing so far. I have enjoyed every minute <br>of  working along with the entire team, brainstorming for hours and coming up with a solution,<br> especially for the recently held competition in NIT Calicut.
                
                    The guest lectures organised so far have <br>been very exciting and worth it. I definitely look forward to more of them.

                    The Aero outing in April was really <br>fun and I hope for more of them to be organised.

                    Plane watching sessions have been one huge positive<br> in developing my interest in planes even more. I have stayed up many nights looking for that Boeing 787 <br>and I have been such a huge influence to my friends who were once not at all interested in planes,<br> but now stay up till 3am to get a glimpse of that one plane. My first ever plane watching<br> session was with Ishan Neogi and Pranjal bhaiya when I took along 5 of my friends early <br>in the morning to the runway and later all of my friends just followed.

			<h4 style= "font-size:17px;">I feel that providing small incentives to everyone helps a lot in building a healthy environment amongst the club members, for example when we were given Red Bull cans in a work session. A similar but smaller incentive could be given to students who regularly and actively participate.
                To avoid doing the entire work myself, I would like to regularly hold work sessions just like we do now, with a lesser frequency initially for the new inductees at least.
                Build sessions should be more frequent as that is the most fun part of being in the Aerodynamics Club. Theoretical concepts relating to flight of a plane/drone can be explained and cleared while building them.
                In the end, I would want the work sessions to be pretty similar to how we have them right now as I personally enjoy them a lot. Club members must have the freedom to work upon the project of their own choice which will ensure maximum output from the members and keep everyone happy.

			<h4 style= "font-size:17px;">Covid hampered our ability to teach the first year (2021) students which was supposed to be the base for us and in learning whatever we are learning now in our 2nd year. The build/fly sessions which we are doing right now, must be done in first year itself as first year students have ample time with them and I feel that can be used really productively. As per my experience, building a trainer styrofoam plane wouldn’t take more than 10 hours of combined work per plane, we can organise 1.5 hour sessions thrice a week and try to complete them within a couple of weeks.
                DroneAcharya is a great initiative and must be held definitely as that will give everyone a great hands on experience and motivate them further.
                When we would have successfully completed such fun projects and given everyone a chance to fly what they built right in their 1st year, I am pretty sure that everyone would be really enthusiastic to start projects in their 2nd/3rd year as they know the potential and what can be achieved.

                I would definitely approach companies and organisations for guest lectures and collaborations with our club as I feel that it is a great way to expose ourselves to many more possibilities and learn what is actually happening in the industry through these sessions.
                    In this case I feel that our BITS Pilani tag will surely help us. We could reach out to the officers at the naval base in Goa and I feel that they would be very excited to come and give a talk.

                    Collaborations are always achieved with the balance of understanding and requirements of both the parties involved and what we hope to get out of it. Being direct and honest about what what we hope for is a great way and should give them a reason enough to collaborate with. We could also tell them about our past avhievements and our future goals which should motivate them further to come and collab with us.

                Clarity and consistency should be our focus on the social media platforms for the upcoming year. The pages must never be left dormant and without any activity and a great way to not do this is to introduce a weekly/monthly series of posts which could be put up regularly according to the timeline. This would eliminate the need to brainstorm every time for an idea. For example a weekly word guess, an aviation news wrap
                The promotion should be done by keeping in mind:
                    Time to publish
                    Targeting the right audience
                    Creating an emailing list (sharing the content timely via mail as well)
                Attracting large participation from the freshers for the inductions should be another focus of the social media pages.
                Collaborating with the clubs of our own college is a great way to reach out to a larger audience and is also mutually beneficial as we recently did in the case of our collaboration with Nirmaan.

                Whenever associating with another club for an event, I would first want to keep myself updated with the entire proceedings of the event as it will come very handy in situations such as this. Also being a POR, it would be my responsibility to be able to manage the event even if my colleagues are out of reach at the moment. Hence I would keep myself updated with what our partnering club was willing to do so that we proceed smoothly. Therefore, I would make myself very approachable so that anybody could come talk to me about their event and how they would like to do it.
                In the case of a conflict with another club, I would first like to listen to what both sides have to say. I would consider the more sensible and feasible option irrespective of any bias towards any club. Most of the time in a conflict, people have to compromise but I would like to go ahead with the option which interests most of the people and which causes minimum harm to the non-beneficiaries.
                Disclosing conflicts of interests is also very important to maintain good terms between both the clubs as it helps the work force to be transparent and accountable for their actions and decisions.

                    Introducing building RC Helicopters. If we can build planes and drones, we can definitely try to build helicopters as well
                    We could organise quizzes based on Aero knowledge and on whatever is happening around the world in the Aero industry
                    We can organise a glider build workshop for the freshers, as a pre induction event….an incentive of direct entry into club can be given to the best performers
                    Aerogami (Craft plane build workshop- Origami for aeroplanes- requiring just imagination- the winner’s idea could also be used to develop a unique prototype, if feasible)
                    This could also be modified into a drawing/designing competition/event

                    Mayday Mysteries is a great event for all plane enthusiasts. I personally know many people who are not a part of the Aero club but still interested in such events where they brainstorm and uncover the mystery behind the plane’s crash.
                    We had many clashes the last time this event was held. More than half of the 2021 batch wasn’t even present on campus hence the event did not receive as much popularity as it should have.
                    This event should definitely be organised again in the future, and if possible it could also be organised as a Pre-Quark event. This is an amazing opportunity for us to promote our club and events which we could conduct in Quark as well. I am pretty sure that students from all the batches will take part in this event very enthusiastically.
